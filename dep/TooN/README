To use:

1) Make sure you have a suitable compiler (g++ version < 3 is no good)

2) Make sure all these files are in your include path.

3) Then

#include <numerics.h>
and
#include <numhelpers.h> // (if you want a few extras)
#include <SVD.h>        // (if you want singular value decompositions)
#include <LU.h>         // (if you want lu triangular decompositions)
#include <SymEigen.h>   // (if you want Eigen decomposition of symmetric matrices)

4) Finally you need to link with -llapack -lblas 
(and -lg2c for g++ I'm not sure about other compilers)

(this means you will also need liblapack.{a,so} and libblas.{a,so})

That's it.
